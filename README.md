# Gridiron Grandmaster
## Description
Gridiron Grandmaster provides a new, fresh perspective on the classic Fantasy Football experienceby allowing the user the ability to act as if they are a team owner, rather than a coach. Users are able to create an account where they choose their Owner Name, and three NFL teams. Based on the win/loss record of the three teams they choose, they will be given a Total Wins and Losses integer which then places them at a certain ranking number out of the total number of other Owners.

## User Story
As A USER I want to be able to log in to the Gridiron Grandmaster application and view the current NFL teams that I own, along with the win/loss records for my teams and their ranking against the other owners. If I don’t have an account, I want to be able to sign up, select three NFL teams and be redirect to the owner’s homepage.
